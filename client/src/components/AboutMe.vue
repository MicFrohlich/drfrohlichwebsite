    <p>
        Dr Frohlich only works from Sunninghill Hospital.
        For any emergency or a/h services, please, use only the Sunninghill Hospital.
        Should you chose to go to any other Institution, there are very good obstetricians
        and gynecologists available locally to help you. Dr Frohlich cannot advise them what
        to do and he does not travel to any other Clinic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dr Frohlich does not read emails or any other messages instantly.
        These are read at his leisure, maybe once a day.
        He replies when he has got time available, strictly during office hours.
        Emergencies are not accepted by digital means.
    </p>
    <p>
       Dr Frohlich does not conduct any professional business on skype, facebook, email,
       wechat, whatsapp or any other digital platform. Consultations, diagnosis or
       treatment cannot be made on line safely or correctly. For any emergency Dr Frohlich
       or his locum will have to listen, examine and possibly request tests,
       investigations, admit or treat and have professional supervision and follow up.
       For any other minor complaint, during office hours, the file can be drawn and
       repeat or chronic prescriptions issued and recorded. Dr Frohlich cannot recall
       casual conversations with thousands of patients, dozens of calls a day.
    </p>
    <p>
        In case of an emergency, the best bet is to go directly to Sunninghill Casualty
        if not pregnant or less than 24 weeks pregnant. The Doctor on call can attend
        immediately and call Dr Frohlich or his locum. After 24 weeks pregnant, pre
        booked, please go straight to Sunninghill Maternity where our dedicated team of
        midwives can examine, check and attend to you before informing Dr Frohlich or
        his locum of you and your baby’s condition.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sunninghill Hospital and Maternity are fully fledged units equipped to deal with
        most complex and difficult medical and surgical conditions. We hope you and your
        baby will not need any of our highly specialized units such as our operating
        theaters, blood bank, ICU (intensive care unit) or the PICU (pediatric ICU).
        O&G, Surgical and Medical doctors and facilities are available to deal with the
        most serious conditions which can happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        A 24/7/365 service is offered and Dr Frohlich and his dedicated team of
        colleagues, Dr H. Dahms, T Hassim, Dr K. Kyriasis and Dr S. O’Hanlon cover around
        the clock the Maternity and Emergency Gynecological Services. The team has been
        doing this for over 10 years, very successfully.  In Case of an emergency go to
        Sunninghill Hospital. Casualty or the Emergency Services will attend immediately
        and contact Dr Frohlich or his locum. The all hours Emergency number is
        0824477597. Dr Frohlich will refer you  under 24 weeks pregnant to Casualty from
        where he or his locum will take you in care. After 24 weeks pregnant Dr Frohlich
        will advise you go straight to Maternity where our dedicated team of midwives
        will examine, check and attend to you before Dr Frohlich or his locum will attend
        to you. After hours, week ends, when on leave or ill please follow the
        instructions given on 0824477597 and Dr Frohlich’s locum will take good care of
        you. Dr Frohlich takes over as soon as he is available. Continuity of high
        quality care is maintained.

        Dr Frohlich was trained and registered as an O&G both locally, MMed(O&G) Wits,
        FCOG (SA) and the UK, MRCOG, FRCOG. During his specialization he has been trained
        and attended most of the local and many overseas workshops in Fetal Medicine
        (FMF) and Ultrasound. He regularly attends lectures, workshops, refresher courses
        and congresses on these topic (CME). The equipment I use for Ultrasonography is
        high end and up to date.

        published by the South Africa Medical Association. I hope that you agree that
        fees for service can only be determined by the service provider (Dr) and its
        representatives (SAMA) and not by the consumer or the third party paying for the
        service (medical aid societies or insurance). These fees are referred to by
        insurers as 300% although doctors consider it 100% and we refer to refunds less
        than the charged fee as 33% or 66% or 100% fully refunded.
